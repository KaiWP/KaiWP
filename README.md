  Hello, my name is Kai. I'm a game developer and student that is interested in mechanics programming. I'm currently familiar with Python and C# (I've used Java in the past, but it has been a while). I primarily work in Unity so far and I am learning Unreal Engine 4/5. I also make pixel art assets and sprite sheets.

You can reach me at kaw434@drexel.edu.
